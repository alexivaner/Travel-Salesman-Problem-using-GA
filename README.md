# Travel-Salesman-Problem-using-GA
 This the code for search solution from Travel Salesman Problem. Travel Salesman Problem is a problem where we given numbers of city to visit, we should initiate where the starting point and visitting every city before going back to the start with the fastest and maybe cheapest route. Here I use Genetic Algorithm to solve this kind of problem.

## How to use?
You could examine the code detailly using ipnyb files. 

To run using console you can use "python ev4.py --input ev3a_example.cfg"

you could modify the detail like learning rate, population, and generation in "ev3a_example.cfg"

If you would know the best result we already found, you can use setting from "Best_result.txt"

This code is still under development as requirement for final project of Evolutionary Computational courses

## Powerpoint Slide
In this slide I will explain about how I am doing conduct tournament, crossover, and mutation. Note that my method maybe not the best method. The longer I learn, I found that another crossover method should be better to solve this Travel Salesman Problem. For solving Travel ASalesman Problem, another method like Particle Swarm Optimization also very efficient and fast in solve this kind of problem. 

In this chance, I just worked for Genetic Algorithm, for Particle Swarm Optimization, you can visit my friend's Github.
