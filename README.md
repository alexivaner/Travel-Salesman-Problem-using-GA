# Travel-Salesman-Problem-using-GA
 This the code for search solution from Travel Salesman Problem. Travel Salesman Problem is a problem where we given numbers of city to visit, we should initiate where the starting point and visitting every city before going back to the start with the fastest and maybe cheapest route. Here I use Genetic Algorithm to solve this kind of problem.

## How to use?
You could examine the code detailly using ipnyb files. 

To run using console you can use "python ev4.py --input ev3a_example.cfg"

you could modify the detail like learning rate, population, and generation in "ev3a_example.cfg"

If you would know the best result we already found, you can use setting from "Best_result.txt"

This code is still under development as requirement for final project of Evolutionary Computational courses
